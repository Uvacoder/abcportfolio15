    <p class="mb-8">
    I'm a web developer based out of St. Louis, MO,
    where I live with <a href="https://instagram.com/putting.on.love" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">my amazing wife</a> and our four children.
    I enjoy running, LSU football, good whiskey, and reading.
    I am slightly obsessed with keyboard shortcuts and productivity hacks.
