            >Wes Bos</a
        >, this page details the things I use to stay productive. Let's dive in.
    </p>

    <h2>Editor &amp; Terminal</h2>
    <ul class="-ml-4">
        <li>
            Most of the time now my editor is Vim. I used VS Code for years but finally made the jump after using a vim plugin inside VS Code. Depending on the project or my needs at the moment, I'll still jump into VS Code as I'm still figuring out parts of my Vim workflow.
        </li>
        <li>
            I use a theme called Everforest in my terminal, in Vim, and in VS Code.
        </li>
        <li>
            My font in my editor and terminal is
            <a
                href="https://monolisa.dev"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >MonoLisa</a
            >. It's also the monospace font you see on this website. It's highly
            readable and looks excellent. If I have to stare at a font all day,
            it's worth paying for one I enjoy looking at. For my terminal, I used the nerd-font font patcher script to add a bunch of extra icons to it.
        </li>
        <li>
            I use
            <a
                href="https://iterm2.com"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >iTerm2</a
            >
            for my terminal. It's a great improvement over the default macOS terminal.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a
                href="https://fishshell.com"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Fish</a
            >
            is my shell. I used zsh for years (both oh-my-zsh and prezto) and
            fish is a much more enjoyable experience. The intelligent
            autocomplete has changed my life.
        </li>
        <li>
            I use a terminal prompt called
            <a
                href="https://starship.rs"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Starship</a
            >. It's built in Rust so it's super fast, and customizing is done
            via a TOML file so it's dead simple to make it look exactly how you want. I can't recommend it highly
            enough.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I have a lot of terminal aliases and scripts to help me be more
        productive. Here are a few of my favorites:
    </p>

    <ul class="-ml-4">
        <li><code>afk</code> starts my screensaver</li>
        <li>
            <code>weather</code> gets the current weather in your area - try it
            out! Run <code>curl wttr.in</code> in your own terminal.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>please</code> = <code>sudo</code>. Stole this idea from
            <a
                href="https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer nofollow"
                >Paul Irish</a
            >, but I can't seem to find it in his dotfiles anymore.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>rm</code> = <code>trash</code>. I installed
            <a
                href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/trash-cli"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >trash-cli</a
            >, so setting <code>rm</code> equal to <code>trash</code> means
            instead of losing something forever when I run <code>rm</code>, it
            dumps it into my trash so I can still recover it if I need to. I've
            been burned too many times.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>gpub</code> =
            <code>git push -u origin $(git_current_branch)</code>. When you
            start a new branch in git, it's super annoying to have to set the
            upstream origin the first time you're pushing that branch. This
            alias makes it easy to publish a new branch.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Desktop Apps</h2>
    <ul class="-ml-4">
        <li>
            <a
                href="https://firefox.com"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Firefox</a
            >
            is my browser. I occasionally use Brave or Opera to test out Chromium stuff, but mostly stick with
      Firefox. <code>brew install --cask firefox</code>, <code>brew install --cask opera</code> and <code>brew install --cask brave-browser</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a
                href="https://getkap.co"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Kap</a
            >
            is the best app I've found for doing screen captures. You can easily
            export them to MP4 or GIF. Super useful for showing UI changes in
            GitHub PRs.<code>brew install kap</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            I use
            <a
                href="https://rectangleapp.com"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Rectangle</a
            >
            for window management. It gives you keyboard shortcuts for
            rearranging and resizing your windows, and also gives you "window
            snapping", where if you drag a window to a certain edge of the
            screen it will snap to fill part of the screen. I will never be able
            to use a Mac without this app again.
            <code>brew install rectangle</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a
                href="https://insomnia.rest"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Insomnia</a
            >
            is an excellent REST client, used for testing API calls that also
            has top notch GraphQL support. <code>brew install insomnia</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            I use
            <a
                href="https://1password.com"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer nofollow"
                >1Password</a
            >
            for password management across all my devices, and at this point I
            think it's safe to say that I couldn't live without it. I use the
            Family Plan because it gives me shared folders so my wife and I can
            both use it for shared logins and also keep our own logins separate.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Desk Setup</h2>
    <ul class="-ml-4">
        <li>
            I have one 23" HP monitor that work gave us when we went remote.
            It's mounted to the wall with a swivel wall mount I got on Amazon. I'm looking to upgrade to a 27" at some point.
        </li>
        <li>
            To the left of my monitor, my laptop (currently a 16" M1 Pro MacBook) sits on a <a
                href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/curve-for-macbook"
                target="_blank"
                rel="norollow noreferrer"
                >Curve stand by TwelveSouth</a
            >. It frees up desk space and is really minimal.
        </li>
        <li>
            I have some <strong>AudioTechnica over-ear headphones</strong> when I'm in meetings
            or listening to music. The model I have isn't available anymore, but
            <a
                href="https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/headphones/type/over-ear/ath-m40x"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >this model</a
            >
            looks to be pretty much the same thing.
        </li>
        <li>
            I have a
            <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-TONOR-Podcasting-Compatible-TC30/dp/B08CVP2HXP"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Tonor USB Microphone</a
            >
            for meetings. It's pretty affordable and gives better sound quality
            than the built-in laptop mic.
        </li>
        <li>
            I use a Logitech webcam that work provided. Even a cheap webcam has
            far superior video quality than the built-in camera on the MacBooks.
        </li>
        <li>
            I use an
            <a
                href="https://smile.amazon.com/Apple-Keyboard-Wireless-Rechargable-English/dp/B016QO64FI"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Apple Magic Keyboard</a
            >
            and
            <a
                href="http://smile.amazon.com/Apple-MJ2R2LL-A-Magic-Trackpad/dp/B016QO5YWC"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Apple Magic Trackpad</a
            >. I love the gestures on the MacBook touchpad, so I opted for the
            Magic Trackpad instead of a Magic Mouse, but I do hear excellent
            things about the mouse.
        </li>
        <li>
            I have
            <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YFY7H7J"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >this light</a
            >
            set up behind my monitor and webcam for better lighting on video
            calls. I built my desk into a shallow closet in my bedroom and the
            lighting situation is awful. If I don't have this turned on during
            meetings, my face is totally dark.
        </li>
        <li>
            The desk itself is one that I custom built. When we moved in 2020,
            our master bedroom had a walk-in closet and a smaller closet with
            sliding doors. We didn't need both, and I needed an office, so I
            ripped out the shelves, painted the interior of the closet, and
            built a desk that mounts inside the walls. I used 2x4's for the
            frame and made a slab from a few pieces of pine that I then glued
            up, stained, and sealed. It's worked out really well.
