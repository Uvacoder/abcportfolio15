            >Wes Bos</a
        >, this page details the things I use to stay productive. Let's dive in.
    </p>

    <h2>Editor &amp; Terminal</h2>
    <ul class="-ml-4">
        <li>
            My editor is
            <a
                href="https://code.visualstudio.com"
                target="_blank"
                class="font-bold"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >VS Code</a
            >. I am probably one of the last people to make the switch to VS
            Code. I'll probably do a write-up on why I switched, because it took
            a lot for me to leave Atom.
        </li>
        <li>
            I wrote my own theme called
            <a
                href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikemcbride.electron-highlighter"
                target="_blank"
                class="font-bold"
                rel="noreferrer nofollow"
                >Electron Highlighter Syntax</a
            >. It's a slightly more vibrant version of Atom's iconic One Dark
            syntax theme that I've customized to my liking. I have spent way
            more time on this theme than I care to admit. Seriously.
        </li>
        <li>
            My font in my editor and terminal is
            <a
                href="https://monolisa.dev"
                target="_blank"
                class="font-bold"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >MonoLisa</a
            >. It's also the monospace font you see on this website. It's highly
            readable and looks excellent. If I have to stare at a font all day,
            it's worth paying for one I enjoy looking at.
        </li>
        <li>
            I use
            <a
                href="https://hyper.is/"
                target="_blank"
                class="font-bold"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Hyper</a
            >
            for my terminal. It's fast, customizable, and looks great.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a
                href="https://fishshell.com"
                target="_blank"
                class="font-bold"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Fish</a
            >
            is my shell. I used zsh for years (both oh-my-zsh and prezto) and
            fish is a much more enjoyable experience. The intelligent
            autocomplete has changed my life.
        </li>
        <li>
            I use a terminal prompt called
            <a
                href="https://starship.rs"
                target="_blank"
                class="font-bold"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Starship</a
            >. It's built in Rust so it's blazing fast and customizing is done
            via a TOML file, so it's dead simple. I can't recommend it highly
            enough.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I have a lot of terminal aliases and scripts to help me be more
        productive. Here are a few of my favorites:
    </p>

    <ul class="-ml-4">
        <li><code>afk</code> starts my screensaver</li>
        <li>
            <code>weather</code> gets the current weather in your area - try it
            out! Run <code>curl wttr.in</code> in your own terminal.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>please</code> = <code>sudo</code>. Stole this idea from
            <a
                href="https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles"
                target="_blank"
                class="font-bold"
                rel="noreferrer nofollow"
                >Paul Irish</a
            >, but I can't seem to find it in his dotfiles anymore.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>rm</code> = <code>trash</code>. I installed
            <a
                href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/trash-cli"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >trash-cli</a
            >, so setting <code>rm</code> equal to <code>trash</code> means
            instead of losing something forever when I run <code>rm</code>, it
            dumps it into my trash so I can still recover it if I need to. I've
            been burned too many times.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>gpub</code> =
            <code>git push -u origin $(git_current_branch)</code>. When you
            start a new branch in git, it's super annoying to have to set the
            upstream origin the first time you're pushing that branch. This
            alias makes it easy to publish a new branch.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Desktop Apps</h2>
    <ul class="-ml-4">
        <li>
            <a
                href="https://firefox.com"
                target="_blank"
                class="font-bold"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Firefox</a
            >
            is my browser. I occasionally use Brave to test out Chromium stuff, but mostly stick with
            Firefox. <code>brew install firefox</code> and <code>brew install brave-browser</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a
                href="https://getkap.co"
                target="_blank"
                class="font-bold"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Kap</a
            >
            is the best app I've found for doing screen captures. You can easily
            export them to MP4 or GIF. Super useful for showing UI changes in
            GitHub PRs.<code>brew install kap</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            I use
            <a
                href="https://rectangleapp.com"
                target="_blank"
                class="font-bold"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Rectangle</a
            >
            for window management. It gives you keyboard shortcuts for
            rearranging and resizing your windows, and also gives you "window
            snapping", where if you drag a window to a certain edge of the
            screen it will snap to fill part of the screen. I will never be able
            to use a Mac without this app again.
            <code>brew install rectangle</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a
                href="https://insomnia.reset"
                target="_blank"
                class="font-bold"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Insomnia</a
            >
            is an excellent REST client, used for testing API calls that also
            has top notch GraphQL support. <code>brew install insomnia</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            I use
            <a
                href="https://1password.com"
                target="_blank"
                class="font-bold"
                rel="noreferrer nofollow"
                >1Password</a
            >
            for password management across all my devices, and at this point I
            think it's safe to say that I couldn't live without it. I use the
            Family Plan because it gives me shared folders so my wife and I can
            both use it for shared logins and also keep our own logins separate.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Desk Setup</h2>
    <ul class="-ml-4">
        <li>
            I have one 23" HP monitor that work gave us when we went remote.
            It's mounted to the wall with a swivel wall mount I got on Amazon. I'm looking to upgrade to a 27" at some point.
        </li>
        <li>
            To the left of my monitor, my laptop (currently a 16" M1 Pro MacBook) sits on a <a
                href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/curve-for-macbook"
                target="_blank"
                class="font-bold"
                rel="norollow noreferrer"
                >Curve stand by TwelveSouth</a
            >. It frees up desk space and is really minimal.
        </li>
        <li>
            I have some <strong>AudioTechnica over-ear headphones</strong> when I'm in meetings
            or listening to music. The model I have isn't available anymore, but
            <a
                href="https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/headphones/type/over-ear/ath-m40x"

                class="font-bold"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >this model</a
            >
            looks to be pretty much the same thing.
        </li>
        <li>
            I have a
            <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-TONOR-Podcasting-Compatible-TC30/dp/B08CVP2HXP"
                target="_blank"
                class="font-bold"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Tonor USB Microphone</a
            >
            for meetings. It's pretty affordable and gives better sound quality
            than the built-in laptop mic.
        </li>
        <li>
            I use a Logitech webcam that work provided. Even a cheap webcam has
            far superior video quality than the built-in camera on the MacBooks.
        </li>
        <li>
            I use an

                class="font-bold"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Apple Magic Keyboard</a

            and

                href="http://smile.amazon.com/Apple-MJ2R2LL-A-Magic-Trackpad/dp/B016QO5YWC"

                class="font-bold"
                rel="nofollow noreferrer"
                >Apple Magic Trackpad</a
            >. I love the gestures on the MacBook touchpad, so I opted for the
            Magic Trackpad instead of a Magic Mouse, but I do hear excellent
            things about the mouse.
        </li>
        <li>
            I have
            <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YFY7H7J"
                target="_blank"

                >this light</a
            >
            set up behind my monitor and webcam for better lighting on video
            calls. I built my desk into a shallow closet in my bedroom and the
            lighting situation is awful. If I don't have this turned on during
            meetings, my face is totally dark.
        </li>
        <li>
            The desk itself is one that I custom built. When we moved in 2020,
            our master bedroom had a walk-in closet and a smaller closet with
            sliding doors. We didn't need both, and I needed an office, so I
            ripped out the shelves, painted the interior of the closet, and
            built a desk that mounts inside the walls. I used 2x4's for the
            frame and made a slab from a few pieces of pine that I then glued
            up, stained, and sealed. It's worked out really well.
