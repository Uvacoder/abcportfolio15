I've been writing code since about midway through high school, so I'm coming up on ten years now (crazy), granted I really only dabbled in a few different languages here and there until I got into later college and started being much more interested in code. Regardless of that, I can safely say that I've been using text editors for nearly ten years to build programs and applications. I've used a lot of them in that time, so I'd like to talk about a few of them and what I'm using now.

<h1>Notepad</h1>
Let's be honest, what developer has never used Notepad to write code? Especially people who grew up around the same time I did, we didn't have many options in the earlier years unless you were going to pay for software. I have a love-hate relationship with Notepad. I love that it's super clean and minimal. It gets out of the way and just lets you get down to writing things. The hate part is that it doesn't do anything other than that, so it's fairly useless. (PS: Notepad > > > > > > > > > > WordPad)

<h1>TextEdit</h1>
I went to a high school that had Macs in the computer labs, so freshman year of high school I started learning how to work on a Mac. I took my first coding class Junior year of high school (C++ if you were wondering), and we wrote all our code in TextEdit. It was vastly different from the TextEdit we have on our Macs today, but I didn't hate it. Very easy to use, but like Notepad, it didn't have any additional coding features.

<h1>VBA Editor</h1>
I'm not really sure what the editor was called, but my freshman year of college I took a class and we did some programming in Visual Basic and used the built in VBA Macro editors inside Word and Excel. This was a step up from Notepad and TextEdit because it had syntax highlighting and some autocomplete functionality.

<h1>Eclipse</h1>
Huge jump here. I went from working in rinky dink text editors to a massive, enterprise-level IDE for a Java class I took in college. Eclipse has a ton of features, but as an IDE it is also much, much more than a text editor. It obviously has a place for you to write code, but it can also compile code for you so you can run your programs and test them within the application.

<h1>Dreamweaver</h1>
I used this VERY briefly while I was taking an HTML/CSS/Javascript course in college. I hated it. I think I ended up writing most of my code for that class in Notepad or some online tool we used to submit our assignments. I can't really remember.

<h1>Notepad++</h1>
Enter the first code editor I actually loved. After graduation, I had already been working as an intern at WWT (where I work now), and was working with a few teams dabbling in different areas of IT to see what I liked best, so I got to write a lot of code. This is when I first started using Notepad++. It was wonderful. Reusable, recordable macros (a brilliant feature that I used extensively), syntax highlighting, plugins for FTP, autocomplete, tree view of the folder structure in the left pane, file comparison... SUPER customizable. I loved it. I used this for probably close to a year. Until...

<h1>Sublime Text</h1>
The king of them all. Sublime is widely regarded as the best code editor out there. It's free to try (and there's no limit on the trial period, you just get a popup every 20th time you save a file), but $70 to purchase. It's well worth the cost. I used it for free for a while and eventually bought it because I liked it so much. Like Notepad++, it has tons of plugins that let you customize nearly anything you could want, tree view on the left panel, a thousand-foot view/birds eye view of the code on the right hand side so you can easily jump to other parts of your code. It's also got some awesome features baked in like being able to select multiple lines at once, so if you want to edit a class name in CSS, you could select every instance of the class and add on to it everywhere at once. Or perform the same operation on multiple lines, like adding quotes around the text and putting a comma at the end of the line. The command palette allows you to jump into files by typing any part of a file and it will find it for you, change your syntax with just a couple of keystrokes, install packages, etc. And it's super fast. Sublime will always have a soft spot in my heart. I used it for about 2 years, until about a month ago.

<h1>Atom</h1>
The Atom code editor was built by the fine people at GitHub, so it integrates very nicely if you have any repositories there. It can detect changes and highlight files that don't match what you have committed to Git. The idea was to build a small, lightweight editor that was incredibly customizable. The minimal core allows you to install packages to make it do exactly what you want without having to load in the stuff you don't care about. The packages are written in CoffeeScript, which is basically JavaScript, so it's very easy to write packages. And if you don't like the way it looks, you can edit the style sheet or create your own custom UI or syntax theme using LESS. Atom is built on Chromium and it has a built in console, so you can inspect elements on the page and modify them using a style sheet that they give you, which is written in LESS. It's really an incredible product that they've put together and is a fantastic example of the amazing things you can do by pushing the boundaries of web technologies.


If you're a developer, you've got tons of choices in excellent text editors (I'm not saying all of the above are excellent), and you'll no doubt find one that suits you best. If you've used one that you love, feel free to try and sway me!

Peace!

Mike
